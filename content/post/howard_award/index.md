We are thrilled to announce that our esteemed lab member, Howard Qian, has been awarded the prestigious "Distinction in Research and Creative Works" by Rice University. 

This is a university honor for graduating students that will be granted at Commencement and will appear on recipients' transcripts and diplomas. To apply, CS students should submit a work or body of work that illustrates creativity, self-initiation, independence, perseverance, and dedication. In all cases, we expect that students who apply for distinction in undergraduate research in computer science will have produced something that goes beyond the traditional expectations of their coursework.

For Computer Science students, the application process involves submitting a work or body of work that goes beyond the traditional expectations of coursework. Howard's successful application cited his contributions to the RISeg paper, with his first authorship and the paper's acceptance to ICRA being key factors in receiving this honor.

This award underscores the high-quality research being conducted in our lab and highlights Howard's exceptional contributions to the field. We congratulate Howard on this well-deserved recognition and look forward to his continued success in future endeavors.
