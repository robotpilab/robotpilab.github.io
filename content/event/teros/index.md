The Texas Regional Robotics Symposium (TEROS) aims to bring together Texas robotics researchers. TEROS is a one-day event with research talks, poster presentations, and social activities. The goal of TEROS is to share exciting ideas and build new connections in the robotics research community in Texas.

After the success of its [first edition](https://teros-texas.github.io/2022/) at the University of Texas at Austin, the second edition of TEROS is coming to Houston. We are excited to announce that TEROS 2023 will be held on **April 14, 2023** at Rice University's BioScience Research Collaborative (BRC). We are proud to share that, similar to its first edition, this event is free for attendees. The event will be held in-person only and the tickets are limited, so please register at the earliest. We look forward to seeing you soon in Houston.
