abstract: We address the problem of generating force-closed point contact grasps
  on complex surfaces and model it as a combinatorial optimization problem.
  Using a multilevel refinement metaheuristic, we maximize the quality of a
  grasp subject to a reachability constraint by recursively forming a hierarchy
  of increasingly coarser optimization problems. A grasp is initialized at the
  top of the hierarchy and then locally refined until convergence at each level.
  Our approach efficiently addresses the high-dimensional problem of
  synthesizing stable point contact grasps while resulting in stable grasps from
  arbitrary initial configurations. Compared to a sampling-based approach, our
  method yields grasps with higher quality. Empirical results are presented for
  a set of different objects. We investigate the number of levels in the
  hierarchy, the computational complexity, and the performance relative to a
  random sampling baseline approach.
