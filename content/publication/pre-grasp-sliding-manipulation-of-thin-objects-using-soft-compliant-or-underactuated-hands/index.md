subtitle: Best Robotic Manipulation Paper Award Finalist
abstract: Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a
  person across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally
  intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and
  implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We
  present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices, such as
  smartphones and robots, where high-level semantic soft biometrics are
  extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach
  attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in
  clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for identifying
  people in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor
  position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the
  BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and
  demonstration of the system will be available on our website.
