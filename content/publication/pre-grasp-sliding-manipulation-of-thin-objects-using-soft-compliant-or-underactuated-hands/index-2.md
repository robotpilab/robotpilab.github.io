abstract: We address the problem of pre-grasp sliding manipulation, which is an
  essential skill when a thin object cannot be directly grasped from a flat
  surface. Leveraging the passive reconfigurability of soft, compliant, or
  underactuated robotic hands, we formulate this problem as an integrated motion
  and grasp planning problem and plan the manipulation directly in the robot
  configuration space. Instead of explicitly precomputing a pair of valid start
  and goal configurations and then planning a path to connect them in a separate
  step, our planner actively samples start and goal robot configurations from
  configuration sampleable regions modeled from the geometries of the object and
  support surface. While randomly connecting the sampled start and goal
  configurations in pairs, the planner verifies whether any connected pair can
  achieve the task to finally confirm a solution. The proposed planner is
  implemented and evaluated both in simulation and on a real robot. Given the
  inherent compliance of the employed Yale T42 hand, we relax the motion
  constraints and show that the planning performance is significantly boosted.
  Moreover, we show that our planner outperforms two baseline planners and that
  it can deal with objects and support surfaces of arbitrary geometries and
  sizes.
