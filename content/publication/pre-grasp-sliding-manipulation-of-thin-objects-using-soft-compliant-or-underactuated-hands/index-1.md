abstract: Moving a human body or a large and bulky object may require the
  strength of whole arm manipulation (WAM). This type of manipulation places the
  load on the robot's arms and relies on global properties of the interaction to
  succeedâ€”rather than local contacts such as grasping or non-prehensile pushing.
  In this paper, we learn to generate motions that enable WAM for holding and
  transporting humans in certain rescue or patient care scenarios. We model the
  task as a reinforcement learning problem to provide a robot behavior that can
  directly respond to external perturbations and human motion. For this, we
  represent global properties of the robot-human interaction with topology-based
  coordinates that are computed from arm and torso positions. These coordinates
  also allow transferring the learned policy to other body shapes and sizes. For
  training and evaluation, we simulate a dynamic sea rescue scenario and show in
  quantitative experiments that the policy can solve unseen scenarios with
  differently-shaped humans, floating humans, or with perception noise. Our
  qualitative experiments show the subsequent transporting after holding is
  achieved, and we demonstrate that the policy can be directly transferred to a
  real-world setting.
