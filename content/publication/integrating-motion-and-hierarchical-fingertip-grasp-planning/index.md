abstract: In this work, we present an algorithm that simultaneously searches for
  a high-quality fingertip grasp and a collision-free path for a robot hand-arm
  system to achieve it. The algorithm combines a bidirectional sampling-based
  motion planning approach with a hierarchical contact optimization process.
  Instead of tackling these problems in a decoupled manner, the grasp
  optimization is guided by the proximity to collision-free configurations
  explored by the motion planner. We implemented the algorithm for a 13-DoF
  manipulator and showed that it is capable of efficiently planning reachable
  high-quality grasps in cluttered environments. Furthermore, we demonstrated
  that our algorithm outperforms a decoupled integration in terms of planning
  runtime.
