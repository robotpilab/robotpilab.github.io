abstract: In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of herding by
  caging. Given a set of mobile robots (called herders) and a group of moving
  agents (called sheep), we move the latter to a predefined location in such a
  way that they cannot escape from the robots while moving. We model the
  interaction between the herders and the sheep by assuming that the former
  exert virtual "repulsive forces" that push the sheep away from them. These
  forces induce a potential field in which the sheep move in a way that does not
  increase their potential. This enables the robots to partially control the
  motion of the sheep. We formalize this behavior geometrically by applying the
  notion of caging, which is widely used in robotic grasping. We show that our
  approach is provably correct in the sense that the sheep cannot escape from
  the robots. We propose an RRT-based motion planning algorithm, demonstrate its
  probabilistic completeness, and evaluate it in simulations.
