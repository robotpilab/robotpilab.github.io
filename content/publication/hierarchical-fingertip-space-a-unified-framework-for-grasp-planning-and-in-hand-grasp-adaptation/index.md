abstract: We present a unified framework for grasp planning and in-hand grasp
  adaptation using visual, tactile, and proprioceptive feedback. The main
  objective of the proposed framework is to enable fingertip grasping by
  addressing problems such as changes in the weight of the object, slippage, and
  external disturbances. For this purpose, we introduce the Hierarchical
  Fingertip Space (HFTS) as a representation that enables optimization for both
  efficient grasp synthesis and online finger gaiting. Grasp synthesis is
  followed by a grasp adaptation step that consists of both grasp force
  adaptation through impedance control and regrasping/finger gaiting when the
  former is not sufficient. Experimental evaluation is conducted on an Allegro
  hand mounted on a Kuka LWR arm.
