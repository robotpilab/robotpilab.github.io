abstract: '"The support function of a surface" is a fundamental concept in
  mathematics and a crucial operation for algorithms in robotics, such as those
  for collision detection and grasp planning. It is possible to calculate the
  support function of a convex body in closed form. However, for complex
  continuous surfaces, especially non-convex ones, this calculation can be far
  more difficult, and no general solution is available so far. This limits the
  applicability of related algorithms. This paper presents a branch-and-bound
  (B&B) algorithm to calculate the support function of complex continuous
  surfaces. An upper bound of the support function over a surface domain is
  derived. While a surface domain is divided into subdomains, the upper bound of
  the support function over any subdomain is proved to be not greater than the
  one over the original domain. Then, as the B&B algorithm sequentially divides
  the surface domain by dividing its subdomain having a greater upper bound than
  the others, the maximum upper bound over all subdomains is monotonically
  decreasing and converges to the exact value of the desired support function.
  Furthermore, with the aid of the B&B algorithm, this paper derives new
  algorithms for the minimum distance between complex continuous surfaces and
  for globally optimal grasps on objects with continuous surfaces. A number of
  numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed algorithms.'
