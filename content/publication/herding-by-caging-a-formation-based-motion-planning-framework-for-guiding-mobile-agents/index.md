abstract: "We propose a solution to the problem of herding by caging: given a
  set of mobile robots (called herders) and a group of moving agents (called
  sheep), we guide the sheep to a target location without letting them escape
  from the herders along the way. We model the interaction between the herders
  and the sheep by defining virtual “repulsive forces” pushing the sheep away
  from the herders. This enables the herders to partially control the motion of
  the sheep. We formalize this behavior topologically by applying the notion of
  caging, a concept used in robotic manipulation. We demonstrate that our
  approach is probably correct in the sense that the sheep cannot escape from
  the robots under our assumed motion model. We propose an RRT-based path
  planning algorithm for herding by caging, demonstrate its probabilistic
  completeness, and evaluate it in simulations as well as on a group of real
  mobile robots."
