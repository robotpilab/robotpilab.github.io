abstract: Nonprehensile actions such as pushing are crucial for addressing multi-object rearrangement problems. To date, existing nonprehensile solutions are all robot-centric, i.e., the manipulation actions are generated with robot-relevant intent and their outcomes are passively evaluated afterwards. Such pipelines are very different from human strategies and are typically inefficient. To this end, this work proposes a novel object-centric planning paradigm and develops the first object-centric planner for general nonprehensile rearrangement problems. By assuming that each object can actively move without being driven by robot interactions, the object-centric planner focuses on planning desired object motions, which are realized via robot actions generated online via a closed-loop pushing strategy. Through extensive experiments and in comparison with state-of-the-art baselines in both simulation and on a physical robot, we show that our object-centric paradigm can generate more intuitive and task-effective robot actions with significantly improved efficiency. In addition, we propose a benchmarking protocol to standardize and facilitate future research in nonprehensile rearrangement.

summary: We propose a novel object-centric planning paradigm for nonprehensile robot rearrangement manipulation. Our approach focuses on planning desired object motions, which are then realized via robot actions generated online. Experiments show that this paradigm generates more intuitive and efficient robot actions compared to traditional robot-centric approaches.
