abstract: An important challenge in robotics is achieving robust performance in
  object grasping and manipulation while dealing with noise and uncertainty.
  This paper presents an approach for addressing the performance of dexterous
  grasping under shape uncertainty. In our approach, the uncertainty in the
  object's shape is parameterized and incorporated as a constraint into grasp
  planning. The proposed approach is used to plan feasible hand configurations
  for realizing planned contacts using different robotic hands. A compliant
  finger closing scheme is devised by exploiting both the object's shape
  uncertainty and tactile sensing at the fingertips. Experimental evaluation
  demonstrates that our method improves the performance of dexterous grasping
  under shape uncertainty.
