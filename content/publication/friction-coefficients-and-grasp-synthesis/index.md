abstract: We propose a new concept called "friction sensitivity," which measures
  how susceptible a specific grasp is to changes in the underlying friction
  coefficients. We develop algorithms for synthesizing stable grasps with low
  friction sensitivity, as well as for synthesizing stable grasps in the case of
  small friction coefficients. We describe how grasps with low friction
  sensitivity can be used when a robot has an uncertain belief about friction
  coefficients, and study the statistics of grasp quality under changes in those
  coefficients. Additionally, we provide a parametric estimate for the
  distribution of grasp qualities and friction sensitivities for a uniformly
  sampled set of grasps.
