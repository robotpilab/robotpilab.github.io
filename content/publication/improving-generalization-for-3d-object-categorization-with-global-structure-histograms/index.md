abstract: We propose a new object descriptor for three-dimensional data called
  the Global Structure Histogram (GSH). The GSH encodes the structure of a local
  feature response on a coarse global scale, providing a beneficial trade-off
  between generalization and discrimination. Encoding the structural
  characteristics of an object allows us to retain low local variations while
  keeping the benefit of global representativeness. In an extensive experimental
  evaluation, we applied the framework to category-based object classification
  in realistic scenarios. We show results obtained by combining the GSH with
  several different local shape representations, and we demonstrate significant
  improvements compared to other state-of-the-art global descriptors.
