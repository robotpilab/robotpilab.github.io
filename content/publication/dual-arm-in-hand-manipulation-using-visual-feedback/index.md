subtitle: "Best Oral Paper Award Finalist "
abstract: In this work, we address the problem of executing in-hand manipulation
  based on visual input. Given an initial grasp, the robot has to change its
  grasp configuration without releasing the object. We propose a method for
  in-hand manipulation planning and execution based on information on the
  object's shape using a dual-arm robot. From the available information on the
  object, which can be a complete point cloud but also partial data, our method
  plans a sequence of rotations and translations to reconfigure the object's
  pose. This sequence is executed using non-prehensile pushes defined as
  relative motions between the two robot arms.
