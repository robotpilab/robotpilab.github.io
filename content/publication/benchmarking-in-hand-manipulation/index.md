abstract: The purpose of this benchmark is to evaluate the planning and control
  aspects of robotic in-hand manipulation systems. The goal is to assess the
  system's ability to change the position of a handheld object using the
  fingers, environment, or a combination of both. We provide examples of initial
  and goal states (i.e., static object poses and fingertip locations) for
  various in-hand manipulation tasks, given an object surface mesh from the YCB
  dataset. We further propose metrics that measure the error in reaching the
  goal state from a specific initial state. When aggregated across all tasks,
  these metrics also serve as a measure of the system's in-hand manipulation
  capability. We provide supporting software, task examples, and evaluation
  results associated with the benchmark.
