title: Rearrangement-Based Manipulation via Kinodynamic Planning and Dynamic Planning Horizons
abstract: "Robot manipulation in cluttered environments often requires complex
  and sequential rearrangement of multiple objects in order to achieve the
  desired reconfiguration of the target objects. Due to the sophisticated
  physical interactions involved in such scenarios, rearrangement-based
  manipulation is still limited to a small range of tasks and is especially
  vulnerable to physical uncertainties and perception noise. This paper presents
  a planning framework that leverages the efficiency of sampling-based planning
  approaches, and closes the manipulation loop by dynamically controlling the
  planning horizon. Our approach interleaves planning and execution to
  progressively approach the manipulation goal while correcting any errors or
  path deviations along the process. Meanwhile, our framework allows the
  definition of manipulation goals without requiring explicit goal
  configurations, enabling the robot to flexibly interact with all objects to
  facilitate the manipulation of the target ones. With extensive experiments
  both in simulation and on a real robot, we evaluate our framework on three
  manipulation tasks in cluttered environments: grasping, relocating, and
  sorting. In comparison with two baseline approaches, we show that our
  framework can significantly improve planning efficiency, robustness against
  physical uncertainties, and task success rate under limited time budgets."

summary: This paper presents a planning framework for robot manipulation in
  cluttered environments that dynamically controls the planning horizon and
  interleaves planning and execution. The framework allows for flexible
  interaction with all objects and improves planning efficiency, robustness
  against physical uncertainties, and task success rate under limited time
  budgets.
