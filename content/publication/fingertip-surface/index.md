abstract: We address the problem of designing fingertips by leveraging the fact
  that most grasp contacts share a few classes of local geometries. In order to
  maximize the contact areas and achieve more robust grasps, we first define the
  concept of a Contact Primitive, which represents a set of contacts with
  similar local geometries. Thereafter, we propose a uniform cost algorithm,
  formulated as a decision-making process in a tree structure, to cluster a set
  of example grasp contacts into a finite set of Contact Primitives. We design
  fingertips by optimizing to match the local geometry of each contact primitive
  and then 3D print them using soft materials to compensate for optimization
  residuals. For novel objects, we provide an efficient algorithm to generate
  grasp contacts that match the fingertip geometries while forming stable
  grasps. Comparing to a baseline of flat fingertip design, the experimental
  results show that our design significantly improves grasp stability and is
  more robust against various uncertainties.
