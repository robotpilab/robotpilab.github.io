abstract: In-hand manipulation is a crucial ability for reorienting and repositioning objects within grasps. The main challenges are not only the complexity in the computational models, but also the risks of grasp instability caused by active finger motions, such as rolling, sliding, breaking, and remaking contacts. Based on the idea of manipulation without lifting a finger, this paper presents the development of Roller Rings (RR), a modular robotic attachment with active surfaces that is wearable by both robot and human hands. By installing and angling the RRs on grasping systems, such that their spatial motions are not co-linear, we derive a general differential motion model for the object actuated by the active surfaces. Our motion model shows that complete in-hand manipulation skill sets can be provided by as few as only 2 RRs through non-holonomic object motions, while more RRs can enable enhanced manipulation dexterity with fewer motion constraints. Through extensive experiments, we wear RRs on both a robot hand and a human hand to evaluate their manipulation capabilities, and show that the RRs can be employed to manipulate arbitrary object shapes to provide dexterous in-hand manipulation.

summary: We present Roller Rings (RR), a modular robotic attachment with active surfaces that enables dexterous in-hand manipulation when worn by robot and human hands. By angling the RRs such that their motions are not co-linear, we derive a general differential motion model showing that complete manipulation skill sets can be achieved with as few as 2 RRs through non-holonomic object motions. More RRs enhance dexterity with fewer constraints. Experiments on robot and human hands validate the RRs' capability to manipulate arbitrary object shapes and provide dexterous in-hand manipulation.
