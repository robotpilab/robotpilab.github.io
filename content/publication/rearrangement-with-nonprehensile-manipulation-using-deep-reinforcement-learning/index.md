abstract: Rearranging objects on a tabletop surface by means of nonprehensile
  manipulation is a task that requires skillful interaction with the physical
  world. Usually, this is achieved by precisely modeling the physical properties
  of the objects, robot, and environment for explicit planning. In contrast,
  explicitly modeling the physical environment is not always feasible and
  involves various uncertainties. Therefore, we learn a nonprehensile
  rearrangement strategy with deep reinforcement learning based on only visual
  feedback. To do this, we model the task with rewards and train a deep
  Q-network. Our potential field-based heuristic exploration strategy reduces
  the number of collisions that lead to suboptimal outcomes, and we actively
  balance the training set to avoid bias towards poor examples. Our training
  process leads to quicker learning and better performance on the task compared
  to uniform exploration and standard experience replay. We demonstrate
  empirical evidence from simulation that our method leads to a success rate of
  85%. We also show that our system can cope with sudden changes in the
  environment and compare our performance with human-level performance.
