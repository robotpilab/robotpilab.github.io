abstract: We present a new approach for modeling grasping using an integrated
  space of grasps and shapes. In particular, we introduce an
  infinite-dimensional space, the Grasp Moduli Space, which represents shapes
  and grasps in a continuous manner. We define a metric on this space that
  allows us to formalize "nearby" grasp/shape configurations, and we discuss
  continuous deformations of such configurations. We work in particular with
  surfaces with cylindrical coordinates and analyze the stability of a popular
  L1 grasp quality measure Ql under continuous deformations of shapes and
  grasps. We experimentally determine bounds on the maximal change of Ql in a
  small neighborhood around stable grasps with grasp quality above a threshold.
  In the case of surfaces of revolution, we determine stable grasps that
  correspond to grasps used by humans and develop an efficient algorithm for
  generating those grasps in the case of three contact points. We show that
  sufficiently stable grasps stay stable under small deformations. For larger
  deformations, we develop a gradient-based method that can transfer stable
  grasps between different surfaces. Additionally, we show in experiments that
  our gradient method can be used to find stable grasps on arbitrary surfaces
  with cylindrical coordinates by deforming such surfaces towards a
  corresponding "canonical" surface of revolution.
