title: "Multi-Object Rearrangement with Monte Carlo Tree Search: A Case Study on
  Planar Nonprehensile Sorting"
abstract: In this work, we address a planar non-prehensile sorting task. Here, a
  robot needs to push many densely packed objects belonging to different classes
  into a configuration where these classes are clearly separated from each
  other. To achieve this, we propose employing Monte Carlo tree search equipped
  with a task-specific heuristic function. We evaluate the algorithm on various
  simulated and real-world sorting tasks and observe that the algorithm is
  capable of reliably sorting large numbers of convex and non-convex objects, as
  well as convex objects in the presence of immovable obstacles.

summary: The article proposes using Monte Carlo tree search with a task-specific
  heuristic function to solve a planar non-prehensile sorting task where a robot
  needs to push densely packed objects into a configuration where classes are
  separated. The algorithm is evaluated on various simulated and real-world
  sorting tasks and is capable of reliably sorting large numbers of objects,
  including convex and non-convex objects and convex objects in the presence of
  immovable obstacles.
