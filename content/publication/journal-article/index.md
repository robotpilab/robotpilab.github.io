abstract: This work presents a method for achieving complete SO(3) finger gating
  control of grasped objects against gravity, using a manipulation planner that
  operates via orthogonal safe modes of a compliant, underactuated hand absent
  of tactile sensors or joint encoders. The method takes advantage of system
  compliance to allow the hand to more easily switch contacts while maintaining
  a stable grasp, and uses a low-latency 6D pose object tracker for online
  feedback and adaptive recovery from trajectory deviations. The method is
  demonstrated on a real robot manipulating both convex and non-convex objects,
  and represents a valuable step towards realizing true robot in-hand
  manipulation capabilities.
