abstract: Efficient and accurate planning of fingertip grasps is essential for
  dexterous in-hand manipulation. In this work, we present a system for
  fingertip grasp planning that incrementally learns a heuristic for hand
  reachability and multi-fingered inverse kinematics. The system consists of an
  online execution module and an offline optimization module. During execution,
  the system plans and executes fingertip grasps using Canny's grasp quality
  metric and a learned random forest-based hand reachability heuristic. In the
  offline module, this heuristic is improved based on a grasping manifold that
  is incrementally learned from the experiences collected during execution. The
  system is evaluated both in simulation and on a SchunkSDH dexterous hand
  mounted on a KUKA-KR5 arm. We show that, as the grasping manifold is adapted
  to the system's experiences, the heuristic becomes more accurate, resulting in
  improved performance of the execution module. The improvement is not only
  observed for experienced objects but also for previously unknown objects of
  similar sizes.
