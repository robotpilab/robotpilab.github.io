abstract: "In this work, we propose a pick-and-place benchmark to assess the
  manipulation capabilities of a robotic system. The benchmark is based on the
  Box and Blocks Test (BBT), a task that has been utilized for decades by the
  rehabilitation community to assess unilateral gross manual dexterity in
  humans. We propose three robot benchmarking protocols in this work that hold
  true to the spirit of the original clinical tests: the Modified-BBT, the
  Targeted-BBT, and the Standard-BBT. These protocols can be implemented by the
  greater robotics research community, as the physical BBT setup has been widely
  distributed with the Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) Object and Model Set. The
  difficulty of the three protocols increases sequentially, adding a new
  performance component at each level, and therefore aiming to assess various
  aspects of the system separately. Clinical task-time norms are summarized for
  able-bodied human participants. We provide baselines for all three protocols
  with off-the-shelf planning and perception algorithms on a Barrett WAM and a
  Franka Emika Panda manipulator and compare the results with human
  performance."
