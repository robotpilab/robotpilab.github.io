abstract: "Numerous grasp planning algorithms have been proposed since the
  1980s. The grasping literature has expanded rapidly in recent years, building
  on greatly improved vision systems and computing power. Methods have been
  proposed to plan stable grasps on known objects (exact 3D model is available),
  familiar objects (e.g. exploiting a-priori known grasps for different objects
  of the same category), or novel object shapes observed during task execution.
  Few of these methods have ever been compared in a systematic way, and
  objective performance evaluation of such complex systems remains problematic.
  Difficulties and confounding factors include different assumptions and amounts
  of a-priori knowledge in different algorithms, different robots, hands, vision
  systems, and setups in different labs, and different choices or application
  needs for grasped objects. Also, grasp planning can use different grasp
  quality metrics (including empirical or theoretical stability measures), or
  other criteria, e.g. computational speed, or combination of grasps with
  reachability considerations. While acknowledging and discussing the
  outstanding difficulties surrounding this complex topic, we propose a
  methodology for reproducible experiments to compare the performance of a
  variety of grasp planning algorithms. Our protocol attempts to improve the
  objectivity with which different grasp planners are compared by minimizing the
  influence of key components in the grasping pipeline, e.g. vision and pose
  estimation. The protocol is demonstrated by evaluating two different grasp
  planners: a state-of-the-art model-free planner and a popular open-source
  model-based planner. We show results from real-robot experiments with a 7-DoF
  arm and 2-finger hand and simulation-based evaluations."
