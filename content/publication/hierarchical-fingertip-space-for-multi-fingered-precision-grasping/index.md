abstract: Dexterous manipulation of objects by a robot system benefits from the
  ability to generate precise grasps. In this paper, we propose the concept of
  Fingertip Space and its use for synthesizing precision grasps. Fingertip Space
  is a representation that takes into account both the local geometry of the
  object surface and the fingertip geometry. As such, it is directly applicable
  to the object point cloud data and establishes a basis for the grasp search
  space. We propose a model for hierarchically encoding the Fingertip Space that
  enables multilevel refinement for efficient grasp synthesis. The proposed
  method works at the grasp contact level while not neglecting object shape or
  hand kinematics. Experimental evaluation is performed for the Barrett hand,
  considering noisy and incomplete point cloud data.
