abstract: Perching helps small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) extend their time
  of operation by saving battery power. However, most strategies for UAV
  perching require complex maneuvering and rely on specific structures, such as
  rough walls for attaching or tree branches for grasping. Many strategies to
  perching neglect the UAV’s mission such that saving battery power interrupts
  the mission. We suggest enabling UAVs with the capability of making and
  stabilizing contacts with the environment, which will allow the UAV to consume
  less energy while retaining its altitude, in addition to the perching
  capability that has been proposed before. This new capability is termed
  “resting.” For this, we propose a modularized and actuated landing gear
  framework that allows stabilizing the UAV on a wide range of different
  structures by perching and resting. Modularization allows our framework to
  adapt to specific structures for resting through rapid prototyping with
  additive manufacturing. Actuation allows switching between different modes of
  perching and resting during flight and additionally enables perching by
  grasping. Our results show that this framework can be used to perform UAV
  perching and resting on a set of common structures, such as street lights and
  edges or corners of buildings. We show that the design is effective in
  reducing power consumption, promotes increased pose stability, and preserves
  large vision ranges while perching or resting at heights. In addition, we
  discuss the potential applications facilitated by our design, as well as the
  potential issues to be addressed for deployment in practice.
