abstract: We address the problem of fingertip design by leveraging the fact that
  most grasp contacts share a few classes of local geometries. To maximize the
  contact areas for achieving more robust grasps, we first define the concept of
  a Contact Primitive, which represents a set of contacts with similar local
  geometries. Thereafter, we propose a uniform cost algorithm, formulated as a
  decision-making process in a tree structure, to cluster a set of example grasp
  contacts into a finite set of Contact Primitives. We design fingertips by
  optimization to match the local geometry of each contact primitive, and then
  3D print them using soft materials to compensate for optimization residuals.
  For novel objects, we provide an efficient algorithm to generate grasp
  contacts that match the fingertip geometries while forming stable grasps.
  Comparing to a baseline of flat fingertip design, the experimental results
  show that our design significantly improves grasp stability and is more robust
  against various uncertainties.
