title: Object Placement Planning and Optimization for Robot Manipulators
abstract: We address the problem of planning the placement of a rigid object
  with a dual-arm robot in a cluttered environment. In this task, we need to
  locate a collision-free pose for the object that (a) facilitates the stable
  placement of the object, (b) is reachable by the robot, and (c) optimizes a
  user-given placement objective. In addition, we need to select which robot arm
  to use for the placement. To solve this task, we propose an anytime algorithm
  that integrates sampling-based motion planning with a novel hierarchical
  search for suitable placement poses. Our algorithm incrementally produces
  approach motions to stable placement poses, reaching placements with better
  objectives as runtime progresses. We evaluate our approach for two different
  placement objectives and observe its effectiveness even in challenging
  scenarios.
