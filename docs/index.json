Major challenges include the difficulty of obtaining the geometric and dynamic models of the hand, object, and time-varying contacts, as well as the inevitable physical and perceptual uncertainties. Instead of building accurate models to map between the actuation inputs and the object motions, this work proposes enabling the hand-object systems to continuously approximate their local models via a self-identification process where an underlying manipulation model is estimated through a small number of exploratory actions and non-parametric learning. With a very small number of data points, as opposed to most data-driven methods, our system self-identifies the underlying manipulation models online through exploratory actions and non-parametric learning. By integrating the self-identified hand-object model into a model predictive control framework, the proposed system closes the control loop to provide high accuracy in-hand manipulation. Furthermore, the proposed self-identification can adaptively trigger online updates through additional exploratory actions as soon as the self-identified local models render large discrepancies against the observed manipulation outcomes. We implemented the proposed approach on a sensorless underactuated Yale Model O hand with a single external camera to observe the object's motion. With extensive experiments, we show that the proposed self-identification approach can enable accurate and robust dexterous manipulation without requiring an accurate system model or a large amount of data for offline training.","tags":[],"title":"Non-Parametric Self-Identification and Model Predictive Control of Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":false,"categories":null,"content":"Kaiyu Hang has won a National Science Foundation CAREER Award to develop robots that can physically interact with the world through compliance- and motion-based manipulation funnels.\n","date":1688076494,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688076494,"objectID":"5685b3fd1440f7c5b1a66695ff9ecb1b","permalink":"https://vector-wangel.github.io/wowchemy_website/post/national-science-foundation-career-award/","publishdate":"2023-06-29T22:08:14.077Z","relpermalink":"/wowchemy_website/post/national-science-foundation-career-award/","section":"post","summary":"Kaiyu Hang has won a National Science Foundation CAREER Award to develop robots that can physically interact with the world through compliance- and motion-based manipulation funnels.","tags":null,"title":"National Science Foundation CAREER Award","type":"post"},{"authors":["Kejia Ren","Podshara Chanrungmaneekul","Lydia E.

Encapsulating a plethora of potential use cases—from logistics-based packing problems to human-robot service settings—the interactions between a robot and its environment are often difficult to plan and execute precisely, as there will always be some degree of uncertainty in the model of the robot or its environment. This uncertainty has historically elicited conflict within the robot’s internal control schema, as it required both positions and forces of the actuators to be balanced appropriately as to satisfy task requirements. System compliance—either in a software-based or a hardware-based solution—has been largely the key to enabling a robot to overcome such environmental or system-modeling uncertainties. This inherent adaptability in the robot’s kinematic structure can generally simplify planning and control of the robot, which has in turn enabled fundamental advancements in robot manipulation. In this workshop, we will explore the state-of-the in compliance-enabled robot manipulation on numerous fronts. Panelists and speakers will discuss how compliance, and other similar paradigms, have changed formulations and processes for planning, control, design, sensing, learning, optimization, etc. for such robot systems. ","date":1683723600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683723600,"objectID":"a8edef490afe42206247b6ac05657af0","permalink":"https://vector-wangel.github.io/wowchemy_website/event/example/","publishdate":"2023-05-19T18:50:24.126Z","relpermalink":"/wowchemy_website/event/example/","section":"event","summary":"ICRA workshop","tags":[],"title":"\"Compliant Robot Manipulation: Challenges and New Opportunities\" Workshop","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rThe Texas Regional Robotics Symposium (TEROS) aims to bring together Texas robotics researchers.

It is possible to calculate the support function of a convex body in closed form. However, for complex continuous surfaces, especially non-convex ones, this calculation can be far more difficult, and no general solution is available so far. This limits the applicability of related algorithms. This paper presents a branch-and-bound (B\u0026B) algorithm to calculate the support function of complex continuous surfaces. An upper bound of the support function over a surface domain is derived. While a surface domain is divided into subdomains, the upper bound of the support function over any subdomain is proved to be not greater than the one over the original domain. Then, as the B\u0026B algorithm sequentially divides the surface domain by dividing its subdomain having a greater upper bound than the others, the maximum upper bound over all subdomains is monotonically decreasing and converges to the exact value of the desired support function. Furthermore, with the aid of the B\u0026B algorithm, this paper derives new algorithms for the minimum distance between complex continuous surfaces and for globally optimal grasps on objects with continuous surfaces. A number of numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Calculating the Support Function of Complex Continuous Surfaces With Applications to Minimum Distance Computation and Optimal Grasp Planning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew S.

This may be apparent, for example, when the task requires control only about the translational dimensions of the manipulation frame, with disregard to the rotational dimensions. This scenario complicates the computation of the grasp frame trajectory, as the mobility of the mechanism is likely limited due to the constraints imposed by the closed kinematic chain. In this letter, we address this problem by combining a learned, object-agnostic manipulation model of the gripper with Model Predictive Control (MPC). This combination facilitates an approach to simple vision-based control of robotic hands with generalized models, enabling a single manipulation model to extend to different task requirements. By tracking the hand-object configuration through vision, the proposed framework is able to accurately control the trajectory of the manipulation frame along translational, rotational, or mixed trajectories. We provide experiments quantifying the utility of this framework, analyzing its ability to control different objects over varied horizon lengths and optimization iterations, and finally, we implement the controller on a physical system.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Object-Agnostic Dexterous Manipulation of Partially Constrained Trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haoran Song","Joshua A.

This type of manipulation places the load on the robot's arms and relies on global properties of the interaction to succeed—rather than local contacts such as grasping or non-prehensile pushing. In this paper, we learn to generate motions that enable WAM for holding and transporting humans in certain rescue or patient care scenarios. We model the task as a reinforcement learning problem to provide a robot behavior that can directly respond to external perturbations and human motion. For this, we represent global properties of the robot-human interaction with topology-based coordinates that are computed from arm and torso positions. These coordinates also allow transferring the learned policy to other body shapes and sizes. For training and evaluation, we simulate a dynamic sea rescue scenario and show in quantitative experiments that the policy can solve unseen scenarios with differently shaped humans, floating humans, or with perception noise. Our qualitative experiments show the subsequent transporting after holding is achieved, and we demonstrate that the policy can be directly transferred to a real-world setting.","tags":null,"title":"Reinforcement Learning in Topology-based Representation for Human Body Movement with Whole Arm Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Weihao Yuan","Kaiyu Hang","Danica Kragic","Michael Y.

In this work, we rearrange one object at a time in an environment with obstacles using an end-to-end policy that maps raw pixels as visual input to control actions without any form of engineered feature extraction. To reduce the amount of training data that needs to be collected using a real robot, we propose a simulation-to-reality transfer approach. In the first step, we model the nonprehensile rearrangement task in simulation and use deep reinforcement learning to learn a suitable rearrangement policy, which requires hundreds of thousands of example actions for training. Thereafter, we collect a small dataset of only 70 episodes of real-world actions as supervised examples for adapting the learned rearrangement policy to real-world input data. In this process, we make use of newly proposed strategies for improving the reinforcement learning process, such as heuristic exploration and the curation of a balanced set of experiences. We evaluate our method in both simulation and real settings using a Baxter robot to show that the proposed approach can effectively improve the training process in simulation, as well as efficiently adapt the learned policy to the real-world application, even when the camera pose is different from simulation. Additionally, we show that the learned system can not only provide adaptive behavior to handle unforeseen events during executions, such as distracting objects, sudden changes in the positions of the objects, and obstacles, but also can deal with obstacle shapes that were not present in the training process.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"End-to-End Nonprehensile Rearrangement with Deep Reinforcement Learning and Simulation-to-Reality Transfer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyu Hang","Andrew S.

Leveraging the passive reconfigurability of soft, compliant, or underactuated robotic hands, we formulate this problem as an integrated motion and grasp planning problem and plan the manipulation directly in the robot configuration space. Instead of explicitly precomputing a pair of valid start and goal configurations and then planning a path to connect them in a separate step, our planner actively samples start and goal robot configurations from configuration sampleable regions modeled from the geometries of the object and support surface. While randomly connecting the sampled start and goal configurations in pairs, the planner verifies whether any connected pair can achieve the task to finally confirm a solution. The proposed planner is implemented and evaluated both in simulation and on a real robot. Given the inherent compliance of the employed Yale T42 hand, we relax the motion constraints and show that the planning performance is significantly boosted.

In this work, we formulate a generic framework for hand-object configuration estimation using underactuated hands as an example. Due to the passive reconfigurability and lack of encoders in the hand's joints, it is challenging to estimate, plan, and actively control underactuated manipulation. By modeling the grasp constraints, we present a particle filter-based framework to estimate the hand configuration. Specifically, given an arbitrary grasp, we start by sampling a set of hand configuration hypotheses and then randomly manipulate the object within the hand. While observing the object's movements as evidence using an external camera, which is not necessarily calibrated with the hand frame, our estimator calculates the likelihood of each hypothesis to iteratively estimate the hand configuration. Once converged, the estimator is used to track the hand configuration in real-time for future manipulations. Thereafter, we develop an algorithm to precisely plan and control the underactuated manipulation to move the grasped object to desired poses. In contrast to most other dexterous manipulation approaches, our framework does not require any tactile sensing or joint encoders and can directly operate on any novel objects without requiring a model of the object a priori. We implemented our framework on both the Yale Model O hand and the Yale T42 hand. The results show that the estimation is accurate for different objects and that the framework can be easily adapted across different underactuated hand models. Finally, we evaluated our planning and control algorithm with handwriting tasks and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Hand-object configuration estimation using particle filters for dexterous in-hand manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasemin Bekiroglu","Naresh Marturi","Maximo A.

The grasping literature has expanded rapidly in recent years, building on greatly improved vision systems and computing power. Methods have been proposed to plan stable grasps on known objects (exact 3D model is available), familiar objects (e.g. exploiting a-priori known grasps for different objects of the same category), or novel object shapes observed during task execution. Few of these methods have ever been compared in a systematic way, and objective performance evaluation of such complex systems remains problematic. Difficulties and confounding factors include different assumptions and amounts of a-priori knowledge in different algorithms, different robots, hands, vision systems, and setups in different labs, and different choices or application needs for grasped objects. Also, grasp planning can use different grasp quality metrics (including empirical or theoretical stability measures), or other criteria, e.g. computational speed, or combination of grasps with reachability considerations. While acknowledging and discussing the outstanding difficulties surrounding this complex topic, we propose a methodology for reproducible experiments to compare the performance of a variety of grasp planning algorithms. Our protocol attempts to improve the objectivity with which different grasp planners are compared by minimizing the influence of key components in the grasping pipeline, e.g. vision and pose estimation. The protocol is demonstrated by evaluating two different grasp planners: a state-of-the-art model-free planner and a popular open-source model-based planner.

Instead of explicitly modeling the contacts and dynamics in manipulation, we can calculate a map to describe the energy states of different hand-object configurations under an actuation input. Since the system intrinsically steers towards low energy states, the object's movement is uniquely described by the gradient of the energy map if the corresponding actuation is applied. Such maps are pre-calculated for a range of actuation inputs to represent the system's energy profile. We discretize the workspace into a grid and construct an energy gradient-based graph by locally exploring the gradients of the stored energy profile. Given a goal configuration of a simple cylindrical object, a sequence of actuation inputs can be calculated to manipulate it towards the goal by exploiting the connectivity in the graph. The proposed approach is experimentally implemented on a Yale T42 hand. Our evaluation results show that parts of the graph are well-connected, explaining our ability to successfully plan and execute trajectories within the gripper's workspace.","tags":[],"title":"Energy Gradient-Based Graphs for Planning Within-Hand Caging Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyu Hang","Andrew S.

However, most strategies for UAV perching require complex maneuvering and rely on specific structures, such as rough walls for attaching or tree branches for grasping. Many strategies to perching neglect the UAV’s mission such that saving battery power interrupts the mission. We suggest enabling UAVs with the capability of making and stabilizing contacts with the environment, which will allow the UAV to consume less energy while retaining its altitude, in addition to the perching capability that has been proposed before. This new capability is termed “resting.” For this, we propose a modularized and actuated landing gear framework that allows stabilizing the UAV on a wide range of different structures by perching and resting. Modularization allows our framework to adapt to specific structures for resting through rapid prototyping with additive manufacturing. Actuation allows switching between different modes of perching and resting during flight and additionally enables perching by grasping. Our results show that this framework can be used to perform UAV perching and resting on a set of common structures, such as street lights and edges or corners of buildings. We show that the design is effective in reducing power consumption, promotes increased pose stability, and preserves large vision ranges while perching or resting at heights. In addition, we discuss the potential applications facilitated by our design, as well as the potential issues to be addressed for deployment in practice.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Perching and resting -- A paradigm for UAV maneuvering with modularized landing gears","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haoran Song","Michael Y.

Usually, this is achieved by precisely modeling the physical properties of the objects, robot, and environment for explicit planning.

Therefore, we learn a nonprehensile rearrangement strategy with deep reinforcement learning based on only visual feedback. To do this, we model the task with rewards and train a deep Q-network. Our potential field-based heuristic exploration strategy reduces the number of collisions that lead to suboptimal outcomes, and we actively balance the training set to avoid bias towards poor examples. Our training process leads to quicker learning and better performance on the task compared to uniform exploration and standard experience replay. We demonstrate empirical evidence from simulation that our method leads to a success rate of 85%.

By adapting the threshold for the probability of dropping the object, the framework can handle objects of different weights without retraining.

The system is evaluated both in simulation and on a SchunkSDH dexterous hand mounted on a KUKA-KR5 arm. We show that, as the grasping manifold is adapted to the system's experiences, the heuristic becomes more accurate, resulting in improved performance of the execution module. The improvement is not only observed for experienced objects but also for previously unknown objects of similar sizes.","tags":[],"title":"On the Evolution of Fingertip Grasping Manifolds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyu Hang","Johannes A.

Using a multilevel refinement metaheuristic, we maximize the quality of a grasp subject to a reachability constraint by recursively forming a hierarchy of increasingly coarser optimization problems. A grasp is initialized at the top of the hierarchy and then locally refined until convergence at each level. Our approach efficiently addresses the high-dimensional problem of synthesizing stable point contact grasps while resulting in stable grasps from arbitrary initial configurations. Compared to a sampling-based approach, our method yields grasps with higher quality. Empirical results are presented for a set of different objects. We investigate the number of levels in the hierarchy, the computational complexity, and the performance relative to a random sampling baseline approach.","tags":[],"title":"Combinatorial Optimization for Hierarchical Contact-level Grasping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyu Hang","Johannes A.

In this paper, we propose the concept of Fingertip Space and its use for synthesizing precision grasps. Fingertip Space is a representation that takes into account both the local geometry of the object surface and the fingertip geometry. As such, it is directly applicable to the object point cloud data and establishes a basis for the grasp search space. We propose a model for hierarchically encoding the Fingertip Space that enables multilevel refinement for efficient grasp synthesis. The proposed method works at the grasp contact level while not neglecting object shape or hand kinematics. Experimental evaluation is performed for the Barrett hand, considering noisy and incomplete point cloud data.","tags":[],"title":"Hierarchical Fingertip Space for Multi-fingered Precision Grasping","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian T.

In particular, we introduce an infinite-dimensional space, the Grasp Moduli Space, which represents shapes and grasps in a continuous manner. We define a metric on this space that allows us to formalize \"nearby\" grasp/shape configurations, and we discuss continuous deformations of such configurations. We work in particular with surfaces with cylindrical coordinates and analyze the stability of a popular L1 grasp quality measure Ql under continuous deformations of shapes and grasps. We experimentally determine bounds on the maximal change of Ql in a small neighborhood around stable grasps with grasp quality above a threshold. In the case of surfaces of revolution, we determine stable grasps that correspond to grasps used by humans and develop an efficient algorithm for generating those grasps in the case of three contact points. We show that sufficiently stable grasps stay stable under small deformations. For larger deformations, we develop a gradient-based method that can transfer stable grasps between different surfaces. Additionally, we show in experiments that our gradient method can be used to find stable grasps on arbitrary surfaces with cylindrical coordinates by deforming such surfaces towards a corresponding \"canonical\" surface of revolution.","tags":[],"title":"Grasp Moduli Spaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaiyu Hang","Florian T.
