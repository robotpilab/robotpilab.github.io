# BibTeX File Consistency Check Report - FINAL UPDATE

## Summary

This report documents the issues found and fixed in the .bib files across all publications in the lab's website. The check was performed systematically using a custom Python script that compared .bib files with their corresponding index.md files.

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Wrong Entry Types (CRITICAL) - **RESOLVED**
Several conference papers were incorrectly marked as `@misc` instead of `@inproceedings`:

**Fixed:**
- **B4P** - Changed from `@misc` to `@inproceedings` with proper IROS conference info
- **arccalib** - Changed from `@misc` to `@inproceedings` with proper IROS conference info  
- **hayden** - Changed from `@misc` to `@inproceedings` with proper IROS conference info
- **Interactive** - Changed from `@misc` to `@inproceedings` with proper IROS conference info
- **RISeg2** - Changed from `@misc` to `@inproceedings` with proper IROS conference info
- **UNO** - Changed from `@misc` to `@inproceedings` with proper IROS conference info

### 2. Missing Publication Information (CRITICAL) - **RESOLVED**
Papers that only had arXiv information but were missing journal/conference details:

**Fixed:**
- **Caging** - Added journal information for IJRR (International Journal of Robotics Research)
- **Collision-inclusive-Manipulation** - Added journal information for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters
- **B4P** - Added conference information for IROS
- **arccalib** - Added conference information for IROS
- **hayden** - Added conference information for IROS
- **Interactive** - Added conference information for IROS
- **RISeg2** - Added conference information for IROS
- **UNO** - Added conference information for IROS

### 3. Year Mismatches (CRITICAL) - **RESOLVED**
Papers with incorrect publication years:

**Fixed:**
- **Caging** - Changed from 2024 to 2025 (matches index.md)
- **Collision-inclusive-Manipulation** - Changed from 2025 to 2024 (matches index.md)
- **hand-object-configuration-estimation** - Changed from 0 to 2019 (matches index.md)

## üìä FINAL STATUS

### Recheck Results (Latest):
- **Total publications checked**: 53
- **Publications with critical issues**: 0 ‚úÖ
- **Publications with minor title mismatches**: 26
- **Publications with no issues**: 27 ‚úÖ

### 4. Title Mismatches (MINOR) - **REMAINING**
Papers with different titles in .bib vs .md files:

**Fixed:**
- **a-framework** - Fixed capitalization: "A Framework For" vs "A Framework for"

**Remaining (26 papers):**
- Most are minor capitalization or formatting differences
- Examples: "Benchmarking In-Hand Manipulation" vs "Benchmarking in-hand manipulation"
- These are less critical but should be standardized for consistency

## üéØ KEY FIXES VERIFIED

### Caging Paper (IJRR):
```bibtex
@article{wang2025caging,
    title={Caging in Time: A Framework for Robust Object Manipulation under Uncertainties and Limited Robot Perception},
    author={Wang, Gaotian and Ren, Kejia and Morgan, Andrew S. and Hang, Kaiyu},
    journal={International Journal of Robotics Research},
    year={2025},
    eprint={2410.16481},
    archivePrefix={arXiv},
    primaryClass={cs.RO}
}
```

### B4P Paper (IROS):
```bibtex
@inproceedings{leebron_b4p_2025,
    title = {{B4P}: Simultaneous Grasp and Motion Planning for Object Placement via Parallelized Bidirectional Forests and Path Repair},
    author = {Leebron, Benjamin H. and Ren, Kejia and Chen, Yiting and Hang, Kaiyu},
    booktitle = {IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)},
    year = {2025},
    eprint = {2504.04598},
    archivePrefix = {arXiv},
    primaryClass = {cs.RO}
}
```

## ‚úÖ IMPACT ASSESSMENT

The professor's main concerns have been **completely resolved**:

1. **IJRR paper**: Now has proper journal information and correct year (2025)
2. **Missing journal names**: All published papers now reference the published version, not just arXiv
3. **Wrong entry types**: All conference papers now use `@inproceedings` with proper `booktitle`
4. **Year accuracy**: All publication years now match between .bib and .md files

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (COMPLETED) ‚úÖ
1. **For published papers**: Replace arXiv-only entries with proper journal/conference information ‚úÖ
2. **For conference papers**: Use `@inproceedings` with `booktitle` field ‚úÖ
3. **For journal papers**: Use `@article` with `journal` field ‚úÖ
4. **Verify years**: Ensure publication years match between .bib and .md files ‚úÖ

### Future Improvements (OPTIONAL)
1. **Title consistency**: Standardize title formatting between .bib and .md files
2. **Author formatting**: Use consistent author name formatting (Last, First)
3. **DOI inclusion**: Add DOIs for all published papers
4. **Volume/pages**: Add volume and page numbers for published papers

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED

The following .bib files were corrected:
- `content/publication/Caging/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/B4P/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/arccalib/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/Collision-inclusive-Manipulation/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/hayden/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/Interactive/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/RISeg2/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/UNO/cite.bib` ‚úÖ
- `content/publication/hand-object-configuration-estimation-using-particle-filters-for-dexterous-in-hand-manipulation/cite.bib` ‚úÖ

## üéâ CONCLUSION

**All critical issues identified by the professor have been successfully resolved.** The .bib files now properly reference published versions with correct entry types, journal/conference information, and publication years. This ensures that when other researchers cite these papers, they will get accurate publication information.

The remaining 26 title mismatches are minor formatting issues that don't affect citation accuracy and can be addressed for consistency if desired.
